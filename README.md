# Grade-Visualization-System

## Abstract
This project implements a multithreaded Python client-server architecture with a client-side Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create a networking application that data mines class grades from the server. The application provides faculty and students with course and grade-related information differentiated by their role in the class in a visually appealing manner by utilizing a set of libraries and tools including Tkinter, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Dubbed, Grade Visualization System, or GVS, runs the server on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) running Raspberry OS, a variant of Linux for portability, efficiency and cost factors. Both the client and server are run on the same network.

## Results
GVS is a fully working program capable of data mining class information to display grades, class statistics and display a fully editable gradebook. GVS requires information to be stored in the server to have access to it. 

GVS is not just a grade display program, but rather a data visualization program. Information shown in the program depends on what the user would like to see.
